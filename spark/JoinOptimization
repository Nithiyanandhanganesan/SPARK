Join Types:
=============
- Shuffle Hash join
    - Map phase read the table and shuffle the data to send it to right reduce phase.
    - works best when the df is distributed evenly with the key which we are joining on and adequate number of keys for parallelism.
- Broadcast Hash Join
    - Address the problem if one DF is small enough to fit in memory.
- Cartesian join
    - number of rows will explode
- Theta join
    - Inequality join (on a.col1 < b.col1)
- One to many join
    - similar to cartersian
